## AI & Integrity

### 1. On the quiz, what did you mean by 'appropriate use of AI tools'? Can we use ChatGPT to help us understand concepts?

AI tools may be used only as directed by the instructor. For quizzes, do not rely on AI to generate answers unless explicitly permitted. You may use AI tools to study and understand concepts, but you must produce your own work for quizzes and assignments and follow any citation requirements. If in doubt, discuss tool use with the instructor before an assignment or quiz.

## Assessments/Exams

### 1. Will the midterm be cumulative? And what topics should we focus on?

The exact midterm format and scope are not specified in the excerpt. Please check the course syllabus and Canvas announcements for the official guidance. In general, prepare by reviewing material from lectures, readings, and problem sets up to the date of the midterm. Focus on core cybersecurity concepts, attack/defense fundamentals, and any topics highlighted in lectures and problem sets. If you’re unsure, ask the instructor for the precise scope and format.

### 2. Are there any extra credit opportunities available?

Extra credit opportunities are not listed in the provided materials. If extra credit is offered, it will be announced on Canvas or in class and will align with the course objectives and integrity rules. Monitor announcements and ask the instructor if you need confirmation about any potential opportunities.

## Assignments & Projects

### 1. Can I work alone on the group project? I'm having trouble finding a partner.

Group projects are typically collaborative. If you cannot find a partner, contact the instructor or TA as soon as possible to discuss options (e.g., pairing with another student or alternative arrangements). Do not delay; the staff can help you find a partner or advise on next steps. Remember, when collaboration is allowed, you must not copy others’ answers and you should cite sources.

### 2. What format should the final project be in? PowerPoint or written report?

The required format for the final project is specified in the assignment brief on Canvas. If you cannot locate the brief, reach out to the instructor to confirm whether a PowerPoint, a written report, or another format is expected, and review the rubric to ensure you meet all criteria.

## Extensions & Policy

### 1. I was sick last week, can I submit the lab report late without penalty?

Late submission policies are not fully specified in the excerpt. For illness, notify the instructor promptly and provide any required documentation. Extensions or accommodations are typically at the instructor’s discretion and should be requested as soon as possible. Refer to the course policy and communicate with the instructor to determine your options.

## Grading & Clarifications

### 1. I submitted an assignment on time but Canvas shows it as late. Can you check this?

If you believe there is a discrepancy in submission timing, contact the course instructor or TA with details (assignment name, submission time, and evidence). They can review the submission timestamp and adjust if needed. Avoid discussing grade changes in public forums; use official channels for any appeals.

## Help & Guidance

### 1. Can you check this?

For questions about a specific submission or solution, contact the course instructor or TA. Provide details such as the assignment name, what you want reviewed, and any relevant context. Use official channels (office hours or scheduled meetings) rather than informal messages for substantive grading questions.

## Help & Office Hours

### 1. What are your office hours this week? I need help with problem set 3.

Office hours are posted by the instructor and may vary weekly. Check Canvas (Course Home or Syllabus) for the current times and whether sessions are in-person or remote. If you can’t make the listed times, email the instructor or TA to request an alternative appointment.

## Policies

### 1. What are the key academic integrity rules I should follow for this course?

This course follows the UVa/McIntire Honor System. All graded assignments must be pledged. Do not use unauthorized notes, problem sets, old exams, or collaborate without explicit permission. If collaboration is allowed, do not copy others’ answers and always cite sources. Suspected violations may be escalated to the Honor Committee and can result in a zero on the assignment. If you’re unsure what constitutes permissible collaboration or permissible resources, ask the professor. Conscientious Retraction options are available via the Honor Committee contacts.

### 2. Am I allowed to record lectures or discussions in this class?

The general policy prohibits recording class lectures/discussions unless special circumstances or explicit permission are granted. If you have a legitimate need to record, discuss it with the instructor to obtain written permission and follow any additional guidelines they provide.

## Schedule & Deadlines

### 1. When is the assignment due? I can't find it on Canvas.

Assignments and due dates are shown in Canvas under the Assignments page and the course calendar. If you can’t locate something, verify you’re enrolled in the course and are logged into Canvas with the correct account. If it’s still missing, contact the instructor or TA for clarification.

### 2. Inclusive Access and opt-out: When does access start and what happens if I opt out?

Inclusive Access materials are available immediately in Blackboard for the first 14 days. You may opt out by the class add/drop deadline; after that, you will be charged for the materials and access. Opting out removes Blackboard access to the materials, and refunds are not offered. If you opt out, you can still access other course content through standard channels as permitted.

## Technical

### 1. How do I get access to the lab computers? I tried logging in but it says my account doesn't exist.

First, confirm you are enrolled in the course and that your UVA NetID/account is active. Lab access is provisioned through the university IT systems and the course staff can point you to the correct contact. If you see a login error, contact the UVA IT Help Desk and also notify your course instructor/TA so they can assist with provisioning or escalation. When you contact support, include your full name, UVA ID (if applicable), and the course name/section so they can locate your account quickly.

## Well-being & Inclusion

### 1. Where can I find well-being and inclusion resources if I need help?

Campus resources are available for well-being and inclusion, including CAPS and student services, as well as DEI contacts. If you need support, consult the campus resources page or contact the listed services for confidential assistance and guidance.
