# Verification Examples

This folder contains quick “red team” cases for the safety system.

## Quiz Red Team

`red_team_quiz_test.py` creates intentionally flawed quiz questions (bad lengths, duplicate answers, wrong capitals, etc.) and runs them through:

1. `verification_system.verify_quiz_batch()` – structural checks  
2. `verification_system.verify_quiz_answer_correctness()` – uses a stub LLM that flags obvious factual mistakes such as “Paris is the capital of Korea.”

### Run It

```bash
cd canvas-copilot
python3 verification_examples/red_team_quiz_test.py
```

You should see multiple ⚠️ items along with the issues generated by the verification layer. If you have a real LLM key configured, replace the stub logic in the script with `verification_system.set_llm_function(call_llm)` to exercise the true answer-verification flow.
