## Key Messages to Repeat

Throughout presentation, reinforce these 3 themes:

1. **Safety First**: "Multi-layer verification before anything touches students"
2. **Real Impact**: "20-30 hours saved per semester"
3. **Focused Scope**: "Solving 7 problems really well, not 20 problems poorly"

---

## Opening Hook Options

Choose one to start your presentation (after title slide):

**Option 1 - Personal Story**:
"Last semester, I answered the same question 47 times. 'When is the final project due?' I thought, there has to be a better way."

**Option 2 - Shocking Stat**:
"Faculty spend 70% of their time on administrative tasks and only 30% on actual teaching. Today, I'll show you how to flip that ratio."

**Option 3 - Rhetorical Question**:
"How many of you have answered the same student email more than 10 times in a semester? [Pause for hands] What if you never had to do that again?"

---

## Closing Statement

End with this powerful message:

"Canvas AI Co-Pilot isn't about replacing teachers—it's about giving them time back to do what they do best: teach, mentor, and inspire. By automating the repetitive tasks, we free faculty to focus on the human moments that matter most. Let's build this future together."

---

1. "How accurate is the AI?"
2. "What about cost?"
3. "Can I customize it?"
4. "What about student privacy?"
5. "How long to learn?"
6. "Will this replace faculty?"
7. "What if it makes a mistake?"
